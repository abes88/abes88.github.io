          <h4 align = "left"> How does acupuncture work? </h4>
          <p class="lead" align="left">
            Qi flows through the body along channels known as meridians. The body contains nearly 500 different acupuncture points located along these meridians. Modern science has actually shown that the body give off slight electical charges at these points. An imbalance or blockage in the flow of qi at these points can cause many ailments. Imbalances in qi flow can be caused by stress, anxiety, anger, fear, poor nutrition,and even changes in the weather. Acupuncturists concentrate on stimulating the body's energy flow by unblocking these meridians. By restoring qi balance and flow, acupuncture allows the body to heal itself naturelly.

          <p class="lead" align="left">
            The first part of any appointment is based on conversation, as your practitioner listens to the patient describe the symptoms they have been experiencing. They then ask about the patient's medical history in order to get a feel for his or her overall health. The practitioner will also take the patient's pulse in three different places on each wrist in order to determine how well certain orgens are functioning, as well as examine the patient's tounge. The tongue's color and coating can reveal a lot about a person's overall health.

          <p class="lead" align="left">
            After the consultation, the practitioner clean the skin and insert tiny disposable needles into certain acupuncture points on the body, depending on the patient's condition. After 20-30 minutes the needles are removed. Most patients find the process very relexing, and many fall asleep during treatment.

            Depending on the condition being treated, acupuncture treatments can last from one week to several months, or longer. Typically, acupuncture patients being by receiving tratments twice a week at the clinic. As a patient's condition improves, treatments become less frequent until the patient is cured of their illness. While some illnesses remain incurable, acupuncture can go a long way toward alleviating discomfort. Some patients come in for a "tune up" a few times every year in order to maintain an optimum level of health and keep illnesses at bay.
